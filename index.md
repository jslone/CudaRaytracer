# Overview
A real-time GPU raytracer created using CUDA and adaptive thread-block allocation and assignment of rays.

# Final Steps

* Finish up final visual features of raytracer.
* Optimize Data Structures - Manage mesh objects in a locational data structure as to minimize the amount of computation needed to perform intersections.
* Perform Analysis - Gather and analyze framesrate for different scenes and different optimizations.
